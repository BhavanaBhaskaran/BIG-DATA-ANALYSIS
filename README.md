*DESCRIPTION*

The Big Data Analysis on Credit Card Dataset task involves leveraging PySpark to process and analyze a large dataset efficiently. The objective is to demonstrate scalability by handling big data, performing data preprocessing, and extracting meaningful insights. This includes loading the dataset, cleaning missing or inconsistent values and anomalies in credit card transactions and also machine learning techniques Decision Tree had implemented for fraud detection. PySparkâ€™s distributed computing capabilities will be utilized to optimize performance and ensure efficient handling of large-scale data.
